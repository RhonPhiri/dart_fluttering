//Static is a key word that marks a variable as a class variable & not an instance variable i.e. you don't need to instantiate the class & access the variable
//Instance variables only have a value when the class has been instantiated
//Static fields and top-level variables are lazily loaded, i.e their size is calculated by dart only when needed
