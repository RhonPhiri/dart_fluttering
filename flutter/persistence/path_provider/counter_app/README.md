# counter_app

A new Flutter project.

This app was created to practice the skills I gained through the flutter docs on path_provider, a package that allows access to commonly used directories. When used together with dart:i/o, reading and writing data to those directories is achieved.

the main.dart initialises the storage class [CounterStorage]

the homepage deals with the UI

the CounterStorage class is a model that manages all the data using path_provider and dart:i/o
